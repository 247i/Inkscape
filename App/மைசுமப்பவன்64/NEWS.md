==================================================================

General user interface
Color palette

The overall look and options of the Color palette and the Swatches dialog got a massive overhaul (MR #2881):

    When switching the color palette, the switcher shows a colorful preview line for each palette
    Between 1 and 5 palette rows that can be displayed all at once, or scrolled through vertically / using the arrow buttons
    Improved and reliably working settings for padding, tile size and tile shape / auto-stretching

Status Bar

    The layer selection dropdown has been replaced by a layer indicator. Clicking on the indicator opens the new Layers and object dialog. This change improves Inkscape's performance for documents with many layers (MR #3648).
    The status bar contents is now configurable, see Customization section.

Tool bar

    The tool bar width can now be resized and also wraps into multiple columns automatically if the screen height is too small for all icons to fit.
    You can customize which tools will be part of the tool bar in the preferences, see Customization section

Dithering


Inkscape's gradients sometimes suffered from visible steps between colors, a phenomenon also known as gradient banding. Gradient banding is caused by the difference between how many different colors are available for the selected image file format and how many colors a human eye can discern. The effect becomes especially prominent when exporting a gradient that only spans a small color range to a high-resolution image. There just aren't enough colors available for a smooth transition.

Dithering softens these steps by scattering pixels of the different adjacent colors along the gradient, a little bit like a blur.

Dithering is now used both for Export of raster images as well as for displaying gradients on canvas(MR #3812). This functionality requires a special version of Cairo, our rendering engine. This means that it will only be available in the pre-packaged builds (for macOS, Windows and for the Linux AppImage).

For standard Linux package formats (deb, rpm, …), it depends upon your Linux distribution maintainers whether they will patch up the version of Cairo they want to distribute. We hope that this change will one day also be included in the official Cairo packages (Link to ongoing discussion).

Canvas
Page

    The page shadow now has a more realistic, blurry, fade-out look (MR #3128). [TODO: add a small screenshot]
    Settings for the page background / decoration were refactored, see section about Document properties dialog.
    Inkscape documents can now hold multiple pages! Learn more in the section about the new Page tool.

Snapping
Snap bar is now Snap popover
The snap bar has been replaced with a new 'popover'-type dialog, which will unfold when you click on the little arrow symbol in the top right corner, next to the snap symbol. Snap options now have always-visible descriptions, to make them easier to understand (MR #3323).

To activate / deactivate snapping globally, click on the snap symbol in the top right corner or press %.

The popover dialog has two different modes:

    Simple: Only 3 options: snap bounding boxes and paths, activate / deactivate the new alignment snapping). This provides a simple preset for many use cases.
    Advanced: Gives the familiar granular control over every snapping option. Switching from 'Advanced' back to 'Simple' is not merely a visual change, but will reset snap settings to defaults.


Snapping preferences globalized

Snap settings are no longer saved with the document, but are set globally for all documents in the preferences and in the snap popover dialog. The option for enabling snapping in new documents has been removed, as it no longer makes sense.

The options for snapping perpependicularly and tangentially to paths or guide lines have been moved from the document preferences to the snap popover to make them more discoverable. The other snap options from the document settings dialog were removed. [TODO: check whether this is still true at the time of release] 

Alignment and Distribution snapping
During Google Summer of Code 2021, GSOC student Parth Pant worked on adding on-canvas alignment and distribution snapping, with support of the mentors Thomas Holder and Marc Jeanmougin. As a result, three new modes of on-canvas snapping have been added. These new modes make aligning and distributing objects a very easy drag-and-drop operation (MR #3294)..

When on-canvas alignment is active, Inkscape will display horizontal or vertical temporary guide lines that indicate when the selected object can be aligned relative to another object on the canvas. It connects the points of the objects that are in alignment. With distribution snapping, multiple objects close by are taken into account, making it possible to align objects in a grid, with very little effort.

The temporary guide lines only appear while editing / moving objects on the canvas. Once a guide shows up, the movement of the selection is loosely constrained in the direction of the guide.

Alignment and Distribution snapping guide lines display the distance(s) between objects as a little label per default. This can be disabled from Edit → Preferences → Snapping: Show snap distance in case of alignment or distribution snap.

The 'Simple' mode of the snapping popover dialog allows you to simply activate or deactivate Alignment snapping. The 'Advanced' mode gives you additional control by allowing you to en-/disable:

    Self snapping: Toggle alignment snapping for nodes in the same path while editing nodes or node handles
    Distribution snapping: Toggle distribution snapping

Tools
Page tool

The new Page tool (lowest button in the tool bar) allows you to create multi-page Inkscape documents, and to import as well as export multi-page PDF documents. (MR #3486, MR #3785, MR #3821). It supports overlapping pages and pages of different sizes in a single document.

Tool usage:

    To create a new page either:
        click-and-drag on the canvas
        or click on the 'Create a new page' button in the tool controls
    To delete a page, click on the page to select it, then click on the button Delete selected page or use the Del or Backspace keys.
    To move a page on the canvas, click-and-drag it to the desired new position. If the option to Move overlapping objects is active, this will also move any objects that touch the page along with it.
    To change a page's size:
        click on a page whose size you want to change to select it, then drag the square-shaped handle in its bottom right corner
        click on the page, and then choose one of the predefined sizes in the page size dropdown, or enter your size values for the 'Custom' option, by typing them into the field in the form of 10cm x 15cm
    To fit a page to:
        the size of the drawing: make sure to have no object selected before you switch to the Page tool. Then select a page by clicking on it, then click on the button 'Fit page to drawing or selection' in the tool controls
        a selected object: first select the object(s) with the selection tool, then switch to the Page tool, click on a page to select it, then press the the button 'Fit page to drawing or selection' in the tool controls
    To add a label to your page, select the page by clicking on it, then enter a name or label for it into the text field in the page tool's tool controls. Labels are always visible, no matter which tool is currently selected.
    To export a multi-page PDF file, use File → Save a copy … → PDF. This will automatically include all pages.
    To open or import a multi-page PDF or (pdf-based) AI file, use File → Open/Import → select file name → choose to import 'All' pages [Known issue: 'import' moves content of some pages to some far out place in the drawing]

Note: Multi-page SVG files are an Inkscape-specific concept. Web browsers will only display the first page of your document, which corresponds to the 'viewbox' area of the SVG file.
Selector Tool

The tool now allows to set the origin of the selection for precise numerical positioning:

    Click on one of the 9 object handles to select your desired origin for the scaling, or select and then drag the middle handle to the desired position
    A small red circle now indicates the new origin and the x/y position in the tool controls will adjust to the new origin.
    Now edit the x, y, width or height values to move and scale your object using the new origin (MR #2700)
Text Tool

    Kerning options are now symbolized by a button between the subscript and text direction selectors. Clicking on it will open a so-called pop-over, where all previously available options can be found. This change saves space in the Text tool's toolbar.
    Negative kerning values can now be as little as -1000 (previously -100), making them symmetrical to their positive counterparts (MR #2569, MR #3434)
    Padding: Text that is flowed into a shape and standard flowed text now have an additional square-shaped handle in the top right corner. Move the handle to adjust the text padding inside the frame (MR #2769) [Currently broken]
    Exclusion zones: Text can now flow around one or more movable objects:
        Select all object(s) (use only shapes and paths on the same object hierarchy level as the text; no groups / clones / images supported) and the text.
        Set the exclusion zone by going to Text → Set subtraction frames.
        Now you can move the exclusion objects around or edit their shape, and the text will adjust automatically.
        If you want to change the exclusion zones again at a later point, repeat the process with all objects that the text should flow around.

Background info: SVG 2.0 flowed text allows for shape-padding and shape-subtract attributes. shape-padding lets the text flow into a shape and leave some space between its edges and w where the text will start to flow. shape-subtract subtracts shapes with margin, so text can flow around other objects in the scene. These attributes were supported in Inkscape 1.0, but not exposed to the user. This version of Inkscape includes both an adjustable on-canvas knot for changing the padding as well as a Text menu item for setting text subtraction properties with a further knot to adjust it's margins.

[See merge request for animated gifs to add here]
Path Operations

    New Split path operation, available from Path → Split path:
    The function separates a path object that consists of multiple subpaths into a set of path objects that 'belong together'. This means that parts of a path that have holes in them are kept as whole objects. The function works by splitting up a path into non-intersecting bits, keeping intersecting bits together.
    Example: A path that consists of a word, like 'Inkscape' will be split into 8 parts, one for each letter. With the familiar 'Break apart' function, there would be 12 parts, because of the holes in the letters that would be split off as their own objects, too (MR #3738).[TODO: add animation]
    On-Canvas Boolean operations [TODO: fill in if merged, seems to have low probability, lots of work to be done] https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape/-/merge_requests/3357 Osama Ahmad with mentors Thomas Holder, Marc Jeanmougin, Martin Owens

Dialogs
General

    A mini-menu (downward pointing arrow symbol) was added into the title bar of every multi-dialog panel (also called 'notebook'). You can use it to close the current tab, to undock it, or to close the whole panel. It also shows a list of available dialogs, sorted by purpose, allowing you to open them with a click ((MR #3728)
    Open dialogs are now less costly for performance, because they do not update when it's not needed (MR #3369), or when they are hidden (MR #3761)
    Docking zones now expand and flash slowly when a dialog is dragged close to them. This makes it easier to see where docking is possible (MR #3729)
    The text labels of docked dialogs are now more responsive to the width of dialog (MR #3627)

Align and distribute

    The formerly separate Arrange dialog is now integrated with the Align and Distribute dialog. With its three tabs, more user-friendly names and some small visual tweaks, the dialog now holds everything that is needed for aligning, distributing and arranging objects in your drawing (MR #3382, MR #3667).
    The icons inside this dialog are now smaller.
    Node alignment and distribution is nolonger shown on first run Just when you use node editing tool
Document Properties

The 'Snapping' tab was removed in favor of a global snapping preference, see Snapping section.

The first tab of the Document properties dialog was refactored thoroughly to make it easier to use:

    It's now labelled 'Display' instead of 'Page'
    The long list of different document formats is now available from a dropdown
    There is a preview available of the page format and colors [TODO: needs screenshot]
    The page area(s) in a document can now have a different color than the underlying 'desk' area [TODO: mention in highlights?]
    The other options have been rearranged to look tidier
    The option to add margins to a document when resizing it is currently unavailable [TODO: hopefully get that back before the release]

(MR #3700).

(MR #3400, MR #3403)
Fill and Stroke dialog
Color selector

    The more intuitive HSL mode (hue, saturation, lightness) is now the default mode of the color selector.
    All color selection modes (e.g. HSL, HSV, RGB, CMYK, color wheel, CMS) have been moved into drop-down menu, with icons. You can get the old, tabbed look back by disabling the option in Edit → Preferences → Interface: Use compact color selector mode switch (MR #3443).

Gradient Editor is back

A replacement for the gradient editor was added to the Fill and Stroke dialog (MR #2688, Bug ux#67).

This allows you to add, edit and delete gradient stops directly in the 'Fill and Stroke' dialog again:

    to add a new stop, double click on the gradient preview
    to move a stop, click and drag it along the gradient preview or enter the stop offset numerically for more precision
    to remove a stop, click on it to select it, then press the Del or Backspace key
    The Gradient tool toolbar options `repeat mode`, `reverse gradient direction`, a gradient selection library and a list of all stops have been added here, too, so all the options pertaining to gradients are in easy reach.
    we added a preference to auto delete non used gradients. previously, inkscape deletes the non used gradients automatically. now, we made this optional so that, users can preserve those gradients in SVG file. https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape/-/merge_requests/3897

Markers

The markers drop down list has been replaced by a little dialog that displays all available markers in a grid, and even allows you to edit the selected marker! This project was undertaken by GSOC student Rachana Podaralla with the mentors Michael Kowalski, Marc Jeanmougin and Martin Owens (MR #3394, MR #3420).

When clicking on the drop down for the start, middle or end markers, you will see the following:

    a list of markers used in the current document at the top
    below that, a list of all available markers, which also contains some fun new markers!
    at the bottom, the 'Edit' section, with:
        a preview of how the marker will look
        some number fields to change the size of the marker (keep the lock on to scale proportionally)
        an option to scale the markers when the stroke width is changed
        options for changing the marker direction
        the option to change the marker's angle and to have that angle fixed
        marker offsetting options
        a button to enable editing of markers (rotate, scale, move) on the canvas

Custom Dash patterns

To choose your own dash pattern, select Custom in the dash pattern drop-down menu. This will make a new text field show up where you can add your new custom dash pattern by typing in numbers. Each number corresponds to the length of a dash or a gap. It always starts with a dash, and when it reaches the end, it will continue with the first number again, for the next gap or dash. So if you enter an even number of numbers, e.g. '1 1 4.5 4.5' the pattern will be 'dot - short gap - dash - long gap' and then repeat again, and for an uneven number of numbers, the pattern will be inverted when the first 'set' ends.

On the canvas, you can watch how your object changes when you change the custom dash pattern numbers.

[TODO: needs gif]
Other small changes

Line cap and line join order buttons have been reordered, so they match vertically (MR #3402).
Layers and Objects dialog

A new dialog was created that merges the functionality of the familiar 'Layers' and 'Objects' dialogs, with better performance (MR #2466, MR #3635, MR #2466, MR #3741, MR #3597, MR #3645).

It is available from both the 'Layers' and the 'Objects' menu and offers the following functionality:

    a button to toggle between 'Layers' and 'Objects' view
    a list of all layers and objects in the drawing, featuring new icons for the different object types
    8 alternating default colors for layers and the objects in them:
        these colors are used for drawing the paths in the respective layers
        the colors can be set (in case they clash with your theme, or you cannot see the paths that you draw) in the file style.css in your Inkscape preferences directory
    layer and object colors can be customized for each layer/object on its own, by clicking on the vertical color bar at the end of each line
    tiny mask and scissor symbols indicate that a clip or mask is applied to an object
    object and layer names (label, not id) can be changed after a double-click on the current name
    icons for locking and hiding a layer/object light up when you hover over the layer's row:
        click to hide/unhide, lock/unlock, Shift+click to hide/lock other items [TODO: check whether 'on same level' would apply, doesn't work currently]
    holding Alt while hovering over an object in the dialog will highlight that object on canvas
    layers as well as objects can be multi-selected
    the context (right-click) menu for layers provides options to move, delete, rename the current layer, to lock/hide all/other/the current layers, to add a new layer and to convert a layer to a group
    the context menu for objects provides the same options as it would when you right-click on the object on canvas

Note:

    the (partially hidden) setting for path colors in the preferences file is no longer respected. Adjust the style.css file as a workaround.
    the dialog no longer offers the options to change opacity, blur or blend mode. Use the Fill and Stroke dialog as a workaround.
    the type-forward search to filter for objects is no longer available. For objects, use the Search and Replace dialog as a workaround, for layers there is currently no replacement.

[TODO: needs a picture]
Preferences

    The preferences zoom ruler now respects your theme's look (MR #3450)
    An option to make Select same behave like Select all with respect to whether it selects objects only in the current layer or in all layers was added to Edit → Preferences → Behavior → Selecting (MR #2832)

SVG Font Editor

Bug fixes, small face lift and UX and performance improvements of the dialog (MR #3396, MR #3552, MR #3628)

To improve font editing experience new dialog simplifies glyph organization. When editing a font users can start by inserting new glyphs (glyph auto generation makes it easy - press '+' to add new glyphs). Next the user can select a glyph they want to edit and hit "Edit" button. Inkscape will then create a layer dedicated to this glyph, switch to it, and hide other layers. Thanks to this feature canvas can remain uncluttered, with only edited glyph visible.

SVG font dialog improvements:

    speed improvements: Inkscape can now handle fonts with thousands of glyphs
    automatic glyph generation: adding new glyph creates new entry and populates unicode string based on the last defined glyph; pressing '+' creates glyphs with consecutive unicodes
    glyph management: glyph editing action creates glyph-specific layers to keep glyphs organized
    added grid glyph view which offers larger preview than a list

Swatches

The Swatches dialog uses the same improved settings as the color palette.
Text and Font dialog

The dialog's width has been reduced, so it won't take up excessive amounts of space when docked (MR #3314).


Trace Bitmap

The Trace Bitmap dialog received a few updates and some more polish (MR #3405):

    The preview auto-updates more reliably and shows a better preview image.
    The preview location now adjusts to the dialog's format: if it is wider than tall, it moves to the right side, and if it is taller than wide, the preview appears at the bottom of the dialog.
    The number entry fields are now accompanied by draggable sliders.

Transform dialog

We cleaned up this dialog, reduced width and added explanation for metric transformations (MR #3381)


Filters
Live path effects

We added button in to Live Path Effect Dialog that will select parent path that is related to that path. It quality of life feature for Booleans, Copie, etc...

Customization / Theming
General User Interface

    The font size in the user interface can be adjusted at Edit → Preferences → Interface → Theming: Font scale (MR #3690)
    The +/- buttons for number entry fields are now smaller. If you prefer the old, wider buttons, they can be turned on again by disabling Preferences → Interface : Use narrow number entry boxes . (MR #3358)

Bars / Toolbars

    You can now hide elements from the status bar (style indicator, layer indicator, mouse coordinates, canvas rotation) at Edit → Preferences → Interface: Status bar (MR #3445)
    You can now hide tools from the tool bar at Edit → Preferences → Interface → Toolbars: Toolbars (MR #3515)

Editing toolbox.gif [TODO: outdated, needs new recording]
Cursors

    The drop shadow is now optional for mouse cursors. You can turn it off in Edit → Preferences → Interface → Mouse cursors: Show drop shadow (MR #3352).

Icons

    Multiple icons in the Multicolor icons set got small retouches and other improvements to readability or contrast, e.g. the green color is now a little brighter when using a dark theme, to improve contrast.
    Cursors and icons in Multicolor icon theme for the Bézier tool and the Calligraphy tool in the tool bar now use the same imagery [to be confirmed]
    Align and distribute icons are now smaller, some were redesigned to fit in to 16x16 grid.
    The icon sizes for the tool bar and the control / tool controls bar can now be adjusted smoothly on a continuous scale from from 100% to 300% in Edit → Preferences → Interface → Toolbars: Toolbox icon size / Control bar icon size. Changing the size no longer requires a restart.

Themes

    A contrast slider was added for fine tuning the selected theme's colors at Edit → Preferences → Interface → Theming: Contrast (MR #906)

    The contrast slider allows to fine-tune the theme's colors


macOS-specific Changes

On macOS, enable all special menu items in the application menu and hide them from other menus (MR #3767)


Windows-specific Changes

Modifier keys now work with pen input (Commit #46c12b)
Extensions

    Add option to limit output extension to save copy (MR #3600)
    Added Python app dirs dependency (MR #3568) [Is this a bug fix?]

Command line

    'verbs' have been removed. All verbs are available as 'actions' now (see below for more context)(MR #3884, MR #3880, MR #3874).
    A new action for scaling by a factor has been added, it replaces the previous one, which is now called 'grow' (MR #3880).

Behind the curtains

    Gio::Actions: The old 'verbs' were converted to 'actions'. This work was done to prepare for migrating to Gtk4. It also makes it possible to reach them all from the commands palette, to assign keyboard shortcuts them and to use them on the command line. A big part of this work was done by Google Summer of Code student SUSHANT A.A. with the mentors Alexander Valavanis, Ted Gould and Tavmjong Bah.

Symbols

Add support for x, y, width and height SVG2 attributes on <symbol>. Follows logic of <svg> element, which already supported these attributes (MR #3828)
