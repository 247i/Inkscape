Inkex is:

- a general-purpose SVG reading/writing/modification package 
- an object-oriented interface for access to 
  many common SVG attributes, such as paths and styles 
- the Python package that enables Inkscape extensions

Furthermore, :mod:`inkex.gui` provides a way to ship GTK interfaces with extensions, and 
:mod:`inkex.tester` is a package to facilitate unit testing of extensions.
